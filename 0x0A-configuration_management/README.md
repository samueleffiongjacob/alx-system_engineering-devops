> Configuration management is a systems engineering process for establishing consistency of a productâ€™s attributes throughout its life.

Puppet is a tool that helps you manage and automate the configuration of servers. When you use Puppet, you define the desired state of the systems in your infrastructure that you want to manage.

$ ls -l /tmp/school

# view what in the path
$ cat /tmp/school

# apply file second config

$ flask --version

# if error Check Installed Versions: First, verify the versions of Flask and Werkzeug that are installed:

$ pip3 show flask werkzeug


# Reinstall Flask and Werkzeug: To make sure there are no leftover issues, you can force reinstall both packages. eg :

$ pip3 install --force-reinstall Flask==2.1.0 Werkzeug==2.0.3

# re apply build
# check version

# kill running terminal
# with a bash command and puppet .this process require 2 terminall.. 
# first terminal your bash command and second terminal your puppet command

$ ./killmenow
$ puppet apply 2-execute_a_command.pp
