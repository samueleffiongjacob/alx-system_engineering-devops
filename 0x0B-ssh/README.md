A __Secure Shell__, or __Secure Socket Shell__, is a network protocol that allows devices to achieve two important things: communicate and share data. Additionally, the SSH protocol also encrypts data, making it ideal for unsecured networks.

## Learning Objectives

- What is a __server__
- Where servers usually live
- What is `SSH`
- How to create an `SSH RSA` key pair
- How to connect to a remote host using an SSH RSA key pair
- The advantage of using `#!/usr/bin/env bash` instead of `/bin/bash`

Your machine has an SSH configuration file for the local SSH client, letâ€™s configure it to our needs so that you can connect to a server without typing a password. Share your SSH client configuration in your answer file.

Requirements:

Your SSH client configuration must be configured to use the private key ~/.ssh/school
Your SSH client configuration must be configured to refuse to authenticate using a password

## adding a user to a server

```bash
# run the below command
$ echo "ssh pub key here" >> ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
```
