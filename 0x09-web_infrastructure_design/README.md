Web Applications Infrastructure/Web Infrastructure also called internet infrastructure is the physical hardware, transmission media, and software used to interconnect computers and users on the Internet.

- Simple Web Infrastructure
- Distributed Web Infrastructure
- Monitored Web Infrastructure

## Learning Objectives

- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the `*sysadmin/devops*` track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain `system redundancy`
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: `LAMP`, `SPOF`, `QPS`

## Simple Web Infrastructure

![serva 2](./serva%202.png)  
[see lamp stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LAMP_%28software_bundle%29)  

- 1 server
- 1 web server `(Nginx)`
- 1 application server
- 1 application files (your code base)
- 1 database `(MySQL)`
- 1 domain name `foobar.com` configured with a `www` record that points to your server IP `8.8.8.8`

## Distrubuted Web Infrasture

![network diagram](./Network_Architecture_Diagram_-_Distributed_Web_Infrastructure-1.png)

- 2 servers
- 1 web server `(Nginx)`
- 1 application server
- 1 load-balancer `(HAproxy)`
- 1 set of application files (your code base)
- 1 database `(MySQL)`

## Monitored web infrastructure

![3 server](./3%20server.png)

- 3 firewalls
- 1 SSL certificate to serve [see foobar](www.foobar.com) over HTTPS  
- 3 monitoring clients (data collector for Sumologic or other monitoring services)
